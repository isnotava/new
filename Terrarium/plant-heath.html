            <div hidden id="myDIV" class="text-shop" >What are aphids?
                Aphids are small, pear shaped insect that belong to the family Aphidoidea. Aphids, even referred to as pear aphids, are small sucking insects that can be found in all kind of colours. They cause damage to your plants by sucking sap from plant leaves, stems and roots. Aphids reproduce themselves quickly and travel rapidly from one plant to another, which unfortunately gives them great potential of becoming a persistent pest. But do not worry: aphids are relatively easy to control.
            
             What do aphids on plants look like?
                Aphids on houseplants are most commonly green, but also come in purple, white, grey and black. They are generally 5-7 mm (1/8 inch) long and usually cluster on the underside of (new) leaves – or attach themselves to tender new stems.
            
             If you suspect that your plant is suffering from an aphid infestation, be sure to check the underside of the leaves of your plants as aphids love hiding there! They are often clustering on new growth, like young stems and new leaves.
            
             How do aphids damage your plants?
               Aphids pierce the stems and suck the nutrient-rich phloem sap from the plant. This phloem sap contains lots of sugar, vitamins and minerals. A feast meal for the aphid, but not so much for your plant who does need those nutrients herself. Aphids are especially keen on young leaves that are still growing. If your plant is heavily infested, the leaves of your plants will curl, wilt or turn yellow.
            
               After enjoying their feast meal, aphids need to ‘pee out’ all that plant sap they consumed. They do so by secreting a sugary liquid called honeydew, so called aphid pee. This sticky liquid is rich of sugar and attracts ants, hoverflies and parasitoid wasps. Fortunately, when aphids infect your indoor plants, you probably don’t have to deal with these kind of insects. However, honeydew can also encourage the growth of fungus. This is obviously something you want to prevent as fungi can prevent plant growth. Luckily, aphid control is rather easy and can be done all naturally!
            
               How to get rid of aphids on your indoor plants?
              If you spot aphids on your indoor plants, it’s time to take action. An excellent natural way of aphid control is to nurture and pamper their natural enemies. Simple, effective and environmental friendly.
            
              Did you know that ladybugs are the natural enemies of aphids? Both grown ladybugs and ladybug larvae (baby ladybugs) feed on aphids. Ladybug larvae do only want one thing: to become a grown ladybug. And in order to become one, they need to eat a lot. The larvae actually have an insatiable appetite and they just love aphids! The result? happy ladybug, happy plant!</span>

            There are two types of leaf spots. Fungal spots appear brown with a yellow halo and will kill either portions or the entire leaf. Bacterial leaf spots appear water soaked and can also have a yellow halo.

    Solution: Remove the infected leaves, increase the air circulation around your plant and avoid getting water on the unaffected leaves.

        <div hidden id="myDIV4" class="text-shop">
            What are mealybugs?
Mealybugs, even referred to as ‘millie bugs’, are white fluffy bugs who look like tiny balls of cotton wool. Like the aphid and other insect pests, the mealybug steals important nutrients from your houseplants by piercing a tiny hole in the leaf. Then the mealybug sucks out the nutrient-rich sap, robbing your plant of essential nutrients. This weakens your plant and can cause her to die.

Mealybugs are not that picky and can infest all kind of houseplants. If you have a severe mealybug infestation, getting rid of these pesky pests can be tricky. However, do not worry: if you spot them in time, you can effectively control mealybugs on houseplants.

What do mealybugs look like?
Do you spot fluffy wool-like white stuff on your plant? They’re probably mealybugs! Mealybugs are up to 3-5 cm and can easily be seen with the naked eye. Grown mealybugs secrete a white, wool-like wax layer that’s used for protection while they suck out the plant juices.

Mealybug larvae are pink, orange or yellow in color, but as soon as they grow and start feasting on your plant, the small mealybugs will also start secreting this white waxy coating.

Do you think your plant has mealybugs? Isolate infected plant immediately to prevent further spread.

How do mealybugs damage my plants?
Mealybugs pierce small hole in the leaves or stems of your plant so they can suck out the sap from your plant. This nutrient-rich sap is called phloem sap, and is high in sugar, vitamins and minerals. Mealybugs love this sap, but so does your plant. The more mealybugs suck plant fluids from your houseplant, the more malnourished your plant will look.

After the mealybug has enjoyed its feast, it pees out the plant sap again. This sugary insect ‘pee’ is called honeydew. Honeydew attracts not only insects such as wasps and ants, but even mold benefits from this sugary substance. To prevent your plants from getting mold, mealy bug treatment is important.

How to get rid of mealybugs in houseplants
One way to get rid of millie bugs on plants, is by simply spraying them off your plants with a blast of water. Check back after a few days to see if any new eggs have hatched.

Another safe and effective way to deal with mealybugs on your houseplants is by biological control. Nurturing and pampering their natural enemies is a natural and environmental way to get rid of mealybugs.
Lacewing larvae are the natural predators of mealybugs and have an inexhaustible appetite! They will happily help you get rid of those maddening mealybugs.

Lacewing larvae can be purchased online. Simply release them on the leaves of your plants and they will do the job for you – just let nature take its course!

        </div>
        <div hidden id="myDIV6" class="text-shop">
            If small, black bugs are flying around your plants, they’re probably fungus gnats. Below you can read what fungus gnats are and, more importantly, how you can get rid of gnats in your houseplants.

What are fungus gnats?
Fungus gnats – also referred to as soil gnats or dark winged fungus gnats – are small greyish-black flies with long wings that are often found flying around your indoor plants. Adult gnats lay their eggs (and many of them at once!) in the top layer of the moist soil of your plants. The fungus gnat larvae eat the hair roots of your plants and reproduce themselves extremely quickly. Meaning that in no time, you have not one but many gnats terrorizing your beloved plants.

How to identify fungus gnats
Fungus gnats look like fruit flies, but gnats have a more distinct black color and are – opposed to fruit flies – not interested in the overripe bananas in your fruit bowl, but attracted to your beloved plants. Fungus gnats are most active during the beginning of spring and the end of summer and love damp, moist soil.

You’ll see fungus gnats flying around your plants, particularly around the top of the soil. Fungus gnats are tricky to get rid of, but the tips below will help you deal with them – and prevent these annoying soil gnats from coming back!

Get rid of fungus gnats in houseplants
If you notice that one of your plants is infested with gnats, you should isolate the infected plant so the gnats won’t spread to your other green friends.

Even though an adult gnat only lives for around 1 to 2 days, fungus gnats reproduce extremely fast. Female gnats lay over 200 eggs in one go, meaning that those tiny soil flies can become a pretty persistent problem in no time. So how to get rid of gnats in houseplants?

Dehydrate your plant
Fungus gnats are attracted to damp soil, so it is important to never overwater your plants. We recommend choosing a pot with a drainage hole that allows excess water to seep out of the pot, which prevents the plant from root rot.

Have you already spotted gnats flying around your plant(s)? Stop watering the infected plant so the soil can dry out. Gnat larvae need moisture to survive, so they will die in dry soil. Also, dry soil will discourage adult fungus gnats from laying their eggs.  Once the soil has dried out, we recommend changing the soil. Carefully clean the roots of your plants (and the pot!) and pamper your plant with new, clean potting soil.

Scatter sand on top of the potting soil
Top dress a layer of white sand (such as play sand) on top of the potting soil. The layer of sand is unappealing to the gnats and prevents them from laying their eggs. The layer of white sand also robs the larvae of nutrition-rich damp soil. Make sure to scatter a layer of sand on all of your plants. If not, it is likely that you’ll simply shift the problem to your other plants.

Use nematodes
Have you already tried all of the above, but are your plants still terrorized by fungus gnats? Then buy nematodes for fungus gnats.

Nematodes for fungus gnats
Beneficial Nematodes (Steinernema feltiae) are microscopically small, work-like parasites that can’t be seen with the bare eye. Nematodes are the natural enemies of fungus gnats and will seek out and kill fungus gnat larvae in the soil. Depending on the level of fungus gnat infestation, with the help of nematodes you will get rid of fungus gnats within a few days (a light infestation) up to 2-3 weeks (a persistent plague).

First, slightly moisten the potting soil of your houseplants. Then dissolve the nematodes in water and pour this mixture onto the wet potting soil. Make sure to keep the potting soil moist. If no more gnats are present, the beneficial nematodes will also die off.

Beneficial nematodes are harmless to people, pets, animals and of course your plants!

        What are spider mites?
Spider mites are mites that look like tiny spiders. Spider mites are no true insects, but arachnids, meaning that they are related to spiders. The most well-known (and most annoying!) spider mite is the Tetranychus urticae, also referred to as red spider mite or two-spotted spider mite. Spider mites reproduce rapidly, causing lots of damage in a short time. We will show you how to stop these little bastards from infecting your plants and how to prevent future breakouts.

What do spider mites look like and how can you identify them?
Spider mites look like tiny moving dots and live on the undersides of leaves of plants. They can spin webs, just like other spiders, however the webs of spider mites are more cloth-like rather than netted.

When spider mites infest plant leaves, they damage the plant tissue. Small, lightly coloured dots or stippling will appear on the tissue. This causes discoloration, and as the spider mite population grows, the leaves of your plant will turn white, pale or yellow and eventually fall off.

As not all spider mites spin webs, it can sometimes be difficult to identify infestation. Therefore it is important to not only look for delicate webbing underneath the leaves and in the corner of the stems, but also for other signs. The best indicator of spider mite infestation are the tiny white, yellow or tan stippling marks on the leaves of your plants.

Spider mite treatment
Do you suspect that your plant is affected by spider mites? Immediately isolate the plant and remove the infested leaves. Then, use a safe and natural biological control method to get rid of those mites.

The use of spider mite predators is an effective and environmentally friendly method for spider mite treatment. Fortunately, spider mites have several different natural enemies. These natural enemies for spider mite control include ladybugs, predatory mites and lacewings. They all love a bunch of spider mites for supper!

Predatory mites and other insects for spider mite treatment of your indoor plants can be purchased online. Simply release them into the pots of your plants and they will do the job for you! The spider mite predators will consume the spider mites and do not pose any danger to people, pets or your plants.

    <div hidden id="myDIV9" class="text-shop">
        What are thrips?
        Thrips (Thysanoptera) are tiny, slender insects with bristle-like wings. Because they can fly, they are very mobile and can easily head over and infect your other plants. These tiny flies feed by puncturing the plant tissue and sucking out the cell contents. Thrips can basically be found on any of your houseplants. They just love all kind of plants – the more the merrier!
        
        What do thrips look like?
        Thrips are extremely tiny, barely visible insects that are found on the top of the leaves of your plants. To the bare eye, they look like super tiny specks or stripes. Thrips are not the only insects that leave black spots on the leaves of your plants, so use a magnifying glass to make sure it’s thrips you’re dealing with.
        
        Adult thrips have a brown or black body and are 1-2 mm long. Thrips larvae are orange, yellow or green in colour and approximately 1 mm in size.
        
        How do you detect thrips on plants?
        Thrips are mainly found on the growing point of plants, for example under the leaves, on the sprouts of plants and in flower buds. Thrips ‘scrape of’ plant tissue, damage the leave and suck up the sap. This nutrient-rich sap is a real feast meal for the thrips, but it’s much less of a feast for the plant. The plant loses its nutrients, which causes aesthetic damage like silver speckling on the leaves. If you notice those unappealing silver-grey spots on the leaves of your plants, it is very likely that your plant is infested with thrips.
        
        Besides causing aesthetic damage, thrips can also transmit plant viruses. Luckily, your indoor plant are less likely to get affected by plant viruses transmitted by thrips than flower or vegetable crops. But since viruses can cause your plants to die it’s important to identify and get rid of thrips on plants.
        
        Thrips control: how to get rid of thrips
        Thrips are quite difficult to control as they have become immune to many commonly used pesticides. Thrips thrive in lower humidity levels, so increasing humidity and using a plant mister on your plants leaves can help you control those terrible thrips.  Another effective way to get rid of thrips is through biological control.  – lets nature do its work! Assassin bugs like the Reduvius persoatus and predatory mites are preferred predators for thrips control.
        
        Predatory mites and other bugs for thrips prevention and treatment can be purchased online. To prevent thrips, simply release the mites in the pot of your plant to decrease the chances of a thrips outbreak. Your plants will be forever grateful for your loving care!
